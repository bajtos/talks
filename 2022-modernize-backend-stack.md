## Short summary for display

A lot of popular Node.js packages were created ten years ago. Designed for
language idioms of ES5 and capabilities of Node.js version 0.10 or earlier. 
Since then, JavaScript and Node.js added numerous major features: async/await,
HTTP/2, AsyncLocalStorage, Worker threads, Diagnostics channel, ES modules,
WebAssembly, and the list goes on. Unfortunately, too many popular packages did
not keep up their pace with the platform evolution and got stuck in the old
era.

In my talk, I will discuss the problem from various angles: Why did this
happen? Which packages we should consider deprecated? What are their modern
replacements? What criteria to apply when choosing our dependencies?
